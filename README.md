# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Dashboard (Excel)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
In this project, I used **Excel** to create an interactive dashboard analyzing **customer churn data**.  
The dashboard highlights key metrics such as:
- **Total Customers**
- **Churned Customers**
- **Overall Churn Rate**

It also provides deep insights into customer demographics, contract types, churn reasons, and geographic patterns, helping businesses identify churn drivers and improve retention strategies.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset includes customer-level information such as:
- Customer ID  
- Demographics (age, senior status, under 30, etc.)  
- Contract type & billing details  
- Churn label (Yes/No)  
- Churn reasons (competitor, dissatisfaction, price, etc.)  
- Geographic distribution (state-level)
